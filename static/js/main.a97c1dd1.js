The amount of water will depend on how stiff you want the Sadza to be.\\nGradually stir in the maize meal, initially in small amounts to avoid lumps, then steadily increase as it thickens.\\nReduce the heat and simmer, frequently stirring, until it becomes thick and smooth, usually around 15-30 minutes.\\nOnce cooked, mold into individual servings and serve with a relish of greens, beans, or a meat stew like beef or chicken.","ImageLink":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithwhitson/national-dishes-of-the-world/gh-pages/country_pics/Zimbabwe.webp","Image":null,"IsLoaded":true},{"Name":"\xc5land Islands","Pic":"x","Pic Prompt":"I need a pic of the national dish of [\xc5land Islands][\xc5land pancake]","Code":"AX","Title":"National Dish of \xc5land Islands","Dish":"\xc5land pancake","Overview":"The \xc5land pancake is widely recognized as a traditional dish from the \xc5land Islands.
